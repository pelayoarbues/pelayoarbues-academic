Hi folks!

I'm Pelayo Arbués, currently based in Gijón and Madrid, Spain, and I'm the Head of Data Science at [idealista](https://www.idealista.com/), the leading real estate online marketplace in Southern Europe. With 8 years of experience in the industry, I am known for being able to effectively incorporate advanced analytics in products and for increasing awareness of the practical application of advanced analytics.

My academic background is in economics, with a Ph.D. in Transport Economics and regional science. I've worked as a researcher in academia and held past positions as a Senior Data Scientist at BBVA Next and Lead Data Scientist at Weplan.

I'm passionate about problem-solving and love being a manager because it allows me to tackle various challenges related to strategy, processes, and people. My proudest achievements include developing a recommender system with a small team at a large retail company and raising a high-performance team at idealista.

My biggest dream is to apply my skills and experience to help address human challenges, and I aspire to be known for leading a team that works with high ethics and can deliver outstanding solutions.

Outside of work, my hobbies include taking analog street photographs, reading, and spending quality time with my family. I love learning about creative processes, management, and philosophy.
